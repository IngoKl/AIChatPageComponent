# AIChatPageComponent

Do *not* use this in production.

An ILIAS plugin (well, a demo of a plugin) based on [Surlabs AIChatForILIAS](https://github.com/surlabs/AIChatForILIAS) that allows users to embed LLM-powered chats on ILIAS pages.

This is heavily based on [Jesus Copado's AIChatForILIAS](https://github.com/surlabs/AIChatForILIAS).

Also, this has been purely vibe-coded using Claude Code. The code quality, implementation, etc. are absolutely horrendous. This is a demo and nothing else.
